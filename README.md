# Thomas Cruz

Senior associate-level engineer focused on Microsoft 365 security, Purview data governance, and enterprise automation. I build PowerShell/Azure Automation runbooks that export, normalize, and deliver compliance data at scale, and I pair that with Python utilities for analysis.

## What I work on
- 🔐 M365 / Purview content & activity exports (Content Explorer, Activity Explorer, eDiscovery)
- 🧾 Azure AD / Purview role reporting and group population
- 🛠️ Governance automations (labels, SPO, EXO, certs, service principals)
- 📊 Python data utilities to clean, join, and reshape CSV/JSON/Excel

## Repositories to check out
- **purview-content-export-automation** – full runbook flow for large Purview exports
- **m365-identity-and-role-reporting** – Azure AD / Purview role insights
- **data-utilities-python** – CSV/Excel/JSON helper scripts
- **microsoft-copilot-audit-insights** – Web-grounded/XPIA domain analysis

## Tech
PowerShell • Azure/Az modules • ExchangeOnlineManagement • Microsoft Purview • Python (pandas, openpyxl) • Jupyter

> Many scripts use parameterized `<Path>`, `<tenantId>`, and `<M365 group email>` placeholders so they can be shared publicly.
